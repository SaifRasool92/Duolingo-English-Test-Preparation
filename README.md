## What is the DET? (short)
The Duolingo English Test is an online, adaptive English proficiency exam that evaluates reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills. It is designed to be fast, affordable, and delivered remotely on your own computer. Most institutions accept DET scores — always confirm specific score requirements with your target schools.

---

## Test format (overview)
- **Adaptive sections**: many question types adapt to your ability.
- **Timed tasks**: multiple short items and a few longer speaking/writing prompts.
- **Sample item types**: Read & Complete, Read & Select, Listen & Type, Read Aloud, Describe/Write about a photo, Speak about a photo, Read then Write, Listen then Speak.
- **Score range**: 10–160. Many schools publish required score thresholds — check individual admissions pages.

---

## System & environment checklist (before test)
- Use a laptop or desktop (no mobile phones or tablets).
- Front-facing camera, microphone, and working speakers.
- Stable internet connection.
- Valid government-issued photo ID.
- Quiet, well-lit room with a plain background.
- Close other apps and disable notifications.

## Compact 4-week study plan (for busy candidates)

### Week 0 — Diagnostic & setup
- Take the official quick practice to gauge baseline.
- Fix your test environment and tech (camera, mic, lighting).
- Set target score and list top 5 institutions and their DET requirements.

### Week 1 — Foundations (daily ≈60–90 min)
- Daily: 20–30 min targeted vocabulary / grammar drills.
- 30 min: timed practice on reading & listening question types.
- 10–20 min: speaking aloud (read aloud + describe photos).

### Week 2 — Skill building
- Focus on writing tasks: practice short paragraphs (30–45 mins).
- Full timed mini-sections (45–60 mins).
- Record and review speaking responses; self-score vs. rubrics.

### Week 3 — Mocks & calibration
- Take 2 full mock tests (simulate test day) across the week.
- Review mistakes, refine timing and response structure.
- Practice stress management (breathing, clear workspace).

### Week 4 — Polish & test readiness
- Light review, 1 official quick practice, 1 mock test.
- Check ID, environment, and tech again.
- Rest well the day before; do light speaking/writing warmups.

---

## Section-specific tips (practical, short)

### Reading
- Skim for gist first; adapt speed to difficulty.
- For "Read & Complete", think of collocations and connectors.

### Listening
- Focus on keywords and paraphrases.
- Practice transcribing short audio (listen → type).

### Speaking
- Keep answers structured: Point → Explain → Example.
- Speak clearly, a little slower than normal, and avoid long pauses.

### Writing
- Use a quick plan (2–3 sentences outline before writing).
- Keep paragraphs short and coherent; focus on relevance.

---

## Mock test routine (how to review)
1. Simulate test conditions (same time, no interruptions).
2. Save all responses (audio & written) if platform allows.
3. Score yourself against official guide rubrics, or use AI feedback from a mock provider.
4. Track recurring errors and make a short plan to fix them.

---

## Frequently made mistakes
- Poor test environment (noisy, poor lighting).
- Not practicing with timed sections.
- Overwriting — on timed tasks, be concise and accurate.
- Ignoring pronunciation clarity while focusing only on vocabulary.

## Contributing
If you have a useful mock, rubric, or study plan tweak, open a PR or add an issue. Keep contributions practical: sample questions, timed mock scripts, scoring rubrics, or short video walkthroughs are most helpful.

## Good luck!
You’ve already taken a great step by collecting resources — keep practicing smart, track progress with timed mocks, and refine weak areas steadily. If you want, I can:
- generate a printable 2-week daily checklist,
- make a sample timed mock test (with answers & rubric),
- or create short speaking prompts with scoring rubrics.
